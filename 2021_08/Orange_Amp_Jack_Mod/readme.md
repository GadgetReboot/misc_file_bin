# Orange Micro Crush Amp
Add an external Speaker jack - Video here: https://youtu.be/7WM6HoQmDgU<BR><BR>
 
   The concept is to keep the black wire going on to the built in speaker, and also connect the black wire to a new external speaker output jack ground terminal.<BR>
  The output jack used was a switched mono type with 3 terminals.<br><br>
  
  One terminal connects to ground.  Another terminal connects to the amp output orange wire and carries the audio signal.<br>
  When nothing is plugged into the jack, the signal from the orange wire is connected to the third jack terminal, which is wired to the internal speaker.<br>
  When a plug is inserted in the jack, the internal speaker is disconnected and the amp signal is connected to the plug (external speaker).<br><br>
  
  The PCB has a 2 pin connector with a black and orange wire going to the built in speaker.<BR>
  The black wire is the amp ground and the orange is the amp speaker signal output.<BR><br>

  To keep things as neat as possible and not have a bunch of messy taped up wire solder joints, I removed the 2 pin header from the PCB and soldered it to a scrap proto board, which was screwed into the side of the cabinet to hold it in place.<BR>
  Then I soldered a red wire to the proto board and connected it (with a solder bridge) to the orange connector pin.<br>
  I soldered 2 green wires to the proto board and solder bridged those over to the black connector pin.<br>
