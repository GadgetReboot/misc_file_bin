Demo sketch with some cable pin mappings to test<br><br>
Has an OLED menu to scroll with an encoder and click to execute tests<br><br>
There's known bugs but there's also weird behaviour in the Nano<br>
eg. sometimes it may reboot when trying to start a test if the code is changed in ways that shouldn't impact existing functionality.<br><br>
It's as if memory is getting corrupted and causing issues, so an ESP32 may work better with more resources to work with.
