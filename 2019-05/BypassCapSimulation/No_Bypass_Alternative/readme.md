If only a couple of 4.5v bias nodes are needed and if using a few extra resistors happens to be cheaper than a single resistor divider with a bypass capacitor, this method may work without a bypass capacitor.

If the circuit is larger with more stages needing a bias voltage, a single divider with bypass capacitor may be more feasible.
